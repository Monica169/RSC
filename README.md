## Installation
This is my experiment eviroument

python3.7
pytorch1.0

Download PACS dataset from [here](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~dl307/project_iccv2017). Once you have download the data, you must update the files in data/txt_list to match the actual location of your files.

## Training
Experiments with different source/target domains are listed in train.py(L151-158).

## Testing
